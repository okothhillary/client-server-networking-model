# Overview

This project is a **peer-to-peer networking application** that allows each peer to act as both a sender and receiver. As a software engineer, I am working on this project to deepen my understanding of **network programming**, socket communication, and distributed system design.  

The software enables two or more peers to establish direct communication without needing a centralized server. Each peer can send and receive messages, making the communication flow decentralized.  

The purpose of this software is to explore how peer-to-peer communication models work in practice, learn how to manage socket connections effectively, and build a foundation for future distributed applications.
